## Project Overview

The main objective of the project is to enable **real-time measurement and monitoring of vital signs**.

This **wearable device** is designed to address the need for **health prevention** and **daily monitoring of vital indicators**. It continuously measures:

- Oxygen saturation (**SpO₂**)
- Heart rate
- Body temperature

The readings are **instantly displayed** on a screen integrated into the wristband and **automatically and securely transmitted to the cloud** using Wi-Fi.

A **dedicated mobile application** allows:
- The **user** (for self-monitoring), or  
- **Authorized supervisors** (such as doctors or family members)

to:
- View the data  
- Access historical records  
- Receive **immediate alerts** in case of anomalies or risky situations (such as a fall or irregular heart activity)

The system also ensures **data privacy and security** for all personal information.
